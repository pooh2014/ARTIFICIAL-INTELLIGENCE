Installing Keras and Tensorflow in Windows
Installing bleeding edge open source software on a windows machine can end up being very challenging. In this gist I will list out the steps needed to install Keras and Tensorflow in windows machine.

Pre-requisites
A Windows 10 machine
Anaconda python distribution
Steps to set up tensorflow environment
Open anaconda prompt on your computer (you can search for "anaconda prompt" in the search bar)
Type the following in the anaconda prompt and hot enter:

conda create --name tensorflow python=3.5 (здесь указываем версию питона, ее можно узнать по команде python -V)

The previous step will create a new python environment, with python 3.5, named as "tensorflow" (you can name this environment to any name that you deem fit, tensorflow is just a name here)
Now activate your newly created python environment by typing and hitting enter:

activate tensorflow

Now we will install the relevant libraries and packages in this environment
First we will install jupyter by typing the following into the console:

conda install jupyter

Then we will install scipy:

conda install scipy

After this we will install pandas

conda install pandas

Then we will install seaborn

conda install seaborn

Then, scikitlearn

conda install scikit-learn

Then spyder (optional)

conda install spyder

Now tensorflow

pip install tensorflow

pip install Pillow 

pip install opencv-python

Finally keras

conda install -c conda-forge keras

Now run type:

ipython

This will open up an ipython prompt, within this prompt type:

import tensorflow as tf

import keras

If the above runs without error, then you have successfully installed tensorflow and keras. Now, to run tensorflow or keras, all you need to do is go to anaconda prompt and type:

activate tensorflow
jupyter notebook

This will start a jupyter notebook in which you can run tensorflow code.

In case there are any issues with the process described here, please leave a comment. I will be actively maintaining this gist,
